## Dataset
The Dressipi and Tmall datasets used in our experiments are provided in the data/[Dataset] folder. Each dataset contains two folders and several files and including:
- **Folder:**
  - baserec_result: includes the initial recommendation lists and relevance scores generated by three initial recommendation models.
  - rerank_input: includes the relevance score matrices stored in `.pkl` and users' preference and expected product exposure distributions stored in `.json`.
- **Files:**
  - feature_value_with_pop.txt
  - item_feature_remap_with_pop.txt
  - train_session.txt
  - train_purchase.txt
  - valid_session.txt
  - valid_purchase.txt
  - test_session.txt
  - test_purchase.txt

## Model
To run the model, first obtain a license for the COPT solver (version 7.1.1), which can be requested at https://www.shanshu.ai/copt. Then, open the terminal and execute `run_thread.py`:
```
python model/run_thread.py --dataset dressipy --standard DP
```
```
python model/run_thread.py --dataset dressipy --standard EO
```
```
python model/run_thread.py --dataset tmall --standard DP
```
```
python model/run_thread.py --dataset tmall --standard EO
```
